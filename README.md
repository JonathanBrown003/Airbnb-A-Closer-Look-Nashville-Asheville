## Nashville Airbnb Data Analysis
Analyzing the Nashville short-term rental market using Airbnb listings data as well as housing data. 

### Questions to answer:
1) Are there certain zip codes that have noticeably higher ratings than other zip codes?
2) Do the number of reviews per month (good indicator of tenancy) correlate with high ratings for Airbnb units?
3) What neighborhoods would the data recommend we buy an investment property in for short-term rental purposes?
4) Do certain bedroom / bathroom combinations fare better in the short-term rental market?
5) Does the host response rate correlate with higher overall ratings?
6) What are the most common words/phrases used in Airbnb host descriptions? Are these descriptors telling in what we should look for in an investment property?
